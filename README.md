## UDRA 



**U**ltimate **D**ebug **R**oberto **A**rtigas (**UDRA**) is a version of 
the **U**ltimate **D**ebug (**UD**) templates created after the original were modified by Roberto Artigas
and before the Class version modification by John Hickey.

The original _Class_ only modification from _Global_ made **U**ltimate **D**ebug (**UD**) unusable
in a specific way and at the time I was working on a client, so I created a version of the 
working version before the _Class_ changes since I was upgrading **U**ltimate **D**ebug (**UD**) 
with additional features that were needed by the client.

There was feedback to the changes _Class_ only change made, 
and the missing _Global_ was added back so **U**ltimate **D**ebug (**UD**).

So **U**ltimate **D**ebug (**UD**) could now be used again by the client that was being worked on. 
However, I had made several changes and was in the middle of a number of clients 
and could not go back to upgrade **U**ltimate **D**ebug (**UD**) that could work with both the Class and Global.

I continued to use **U**ltimate **D**ebug **R**oberto **A**rtigas (**UDRA**) for those specific clients and 
applications that have been created with those specific unique debug features for those templates.

**U**ltimate **D**ebug (**UD**) might eventually get the additional changes when I have time to go back and upgrade it.
In the meantime, **U**ltimate **D**ebug **R**oberto **A**rtigas (**UDRA**) is being released as a stand alone 
replacement for folks that need the additional features
and have to use an older version of **U**ltimate **D**ebug (**UD**).
