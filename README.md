**U**ltimate **D**ebug **R**oberto **A**rtigas (**UDRA**) are a version of 
the **U**ltimate **D**ebug (**UD**) templates created after the original were modified by Roberto Artigas
and before the Class version modification by John Hickey.

The original Class modification from Global Class broke Ultimate Debug (UD) and at the time I was working on a
client so I created a version of the the working version before the Class changes since I was upgrading
Ultimate Debug (UD) with addititial features that were needed by the client.

There was feedback to the changes Class only change made, and the missing Global Class were added back so Ultimate Debug (UD)
could now be used again by the client that was being worked on. However, I had made several changes and was in the middle of a number
of clients and could not go back to upgrade Ultimate Debug (UD) that could work with both.

Ultimate Debug (UD) might eventually get the additional changes when I have time to go back and upgrade it.
In the meantime, UDRA is being released as a stand alone replacement for folks that need the additional features
and have to use and older version of Utimate Debug (UD).
